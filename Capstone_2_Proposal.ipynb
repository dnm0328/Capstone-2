    "Once I have the data, I will be doing a quick EDA, in order to build a game - by - game \"deficit ranker\" statistic. I am not quite sure how, or which data points I will ust for this yet. With this ranker I will then work towards building a model to predict, given a certain number of games within a season, the liklihood of any given team going to the playoffs for their division/ conference, that year.

With this data set (which I HAVE not found yet) I would want to compare against seasonal times and specific geographic areas in the US in order to understand when and where the most likely interdiction spots could/ would be for Law Enforcement Agencies.
